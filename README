------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Hacking bootcamp focused on binary exploitation, reverse engineering and
(some) practical cryptography.

Motivation
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 This wargame was created to serve as an educational tool, a competition for
passionate students to enjoy. It also served as my Bachelor's Thesis, along
with the written work, where I explored the levels from the perspective of a
player and provided some brief theoretical background for the levels. There
is also a part briefly discussing how to organise a competition using pwncamp.

 You can find the written work here, along with presentation slides and
some prepared virtual disks, containing pwncamp:

Setup
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 You can setup and customise pwncamp yourself! Simply setup a virtual machine,
clone the repo and run "setup.sh". You would have to install the tools needed
for playing yourself, though. 

 My recommendation would be to also change the passwords found in ./rsrc/*. 
This is so your students won't be able to simply find the passwords by google
dorking. You might also want to change the name of the wargame, so they won't
find the sources. Feel free to do that, but if you will distribute it, I'd
appreciate you mentioning my name alongside the remixed wargame.

 The virtual disks I've provided are, if I remember correctly, on some
headless Ubuntu image I found on Ubuntu's official website. I think it was the
mini iso: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/MinimalCD
I picked the 64-bit one, but the binaries for the game are 32-bits.

 If you simply wish to play the levels on your own machine, you can build them
using the provided Makefile. So simply call "make" and go through each level
sequentially. You have to disable ASLR for some of them, though. And you need
to change the binaries' permissions to suid you to read a restrictive pass.txt
file from the same directory. Otherwise it might be harder to know you've
completed the level successfully.


Disclaimer
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 I haven't touched this project in a while. There might be bugs. It also
hasn't been thoroughly tested, as  I haven't managed to find someone willing
to play it. Students are busy people, apprently.


License
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Since this project relies on distributing binaries without the source code,
I felt it would be a bit silly to use GPL. So pwncamp's source code is
licensed under the permissive MIT license. I also kindly ask that any
distribution of the work to credit me as the original creator of the wargame.

 The written work and presentation slides DO NOT fall under the MIT license.
I'm not sure what I'd like to license them under yet, but I think the
Creative Commons (CC BY-NC-SA) would work really well for them. However,
I'm really not knowledgeable in copyright laws, so unsure if the written
work is somehow also in my faculty's copyright domain or something.


Contributing
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Feel free to open issues to suggest collaborations or improvements to it.
There are a lot of things I'd change, but I am currently out of any
motivational juices to keep improving upon it.
